# Design matrix

Let's start with the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ definition

$$
\mathbf{X}=\begin{pmatrix}
    \text{---} \hspace{-0.2cm} & \mathbf{x}^{(1)} & \hspace{-0.2cm} \text{---} \\
    \vdots \hspace{-0.2cm} & \vdots & \hspace{-0.2cm} \vdots \\ 
    \text{---} \hspace{-0.2cm} & \mathbf{x}^{(m)} & \hspace{-0.2cm} \text{---}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This is a $m \times k$ matrix when we have $k$ features and $m$ training examples. For example, maybe we have $k=3$ features such as a student's GPA, GRE and class rank and we have $m=1000$ students in our sample, then we'd have a $1000 \times 3$ design matrix. Each row of that matrix is a vector representing one of our training examples, and the superscript here denotes which training example we are considering.
